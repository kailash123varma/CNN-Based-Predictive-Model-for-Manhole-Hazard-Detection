# CNN-Based-Predictive-Model-for-Manhole-Hazard-Detection

The safety of urban environments remains a paramount concern, with critical infrastructure elements like manholes serving as essential components in regulating sewage systems. However, their neglect or concealment presents imminent hazards. Instances of open manholes have underscored the urgent need for proactive preventive measures. This research introduces a pioneering approach employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict manhole statuses in real time, offering a robust solution to mitigate associated risks. The primary objective is to provide authorities with an agile tool to swiftly detect and address hazardous conditions, thus fortifying public safety. Methodologically, this study entails training a sophisticated CNN model on expansive and diverse datasets, encompassing a spectrum of images and corresponding manhole status labels. Leveraging the potency of deep learning, the model adeptly discerns intricate visual patterns, enabling precise and expeditious prediction of manhole conditions. The proposed innovation stands as a beacon in revolutionizing safety protocols within urban landscapes, propelling a paradigm shift towards proactive risk management concerning open or obscured manholes. Beyond its immediate implications for infrastructure safety, this research underscores a commitment to community well-being by minimizing accidents and hazards. Its implementation heralds a new era in safety approaches, fusing cutting-edge technology with infrastructure management to bolster urban resilience. This groundbreaking research culminates with an impressive accuracy rate of 92.003%, showcasing the efficacy and precision of the employed Convolutional Neural Networks in predicting manhole statuses in real time.
